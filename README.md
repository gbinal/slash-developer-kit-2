/Developer Kit
===================

##Homepage 
The API efforts of any agency should all be accessible via one easy to reach developers hub.  This web page should provide a path to all public APIs and any associated resources.  Once an agency has begun to publish multiple APIs, certain resources may make sense to be specific to each API whereas others may make sense to be provided more generally for all of the agency's APIs.  The major elements of the overall developer homepage are: a catalog of and links to available APIs, any communal elements that apply to all of the APIs, and links to non-API resources that may also be of use to developers.  Agency.gov/developer, agency.gov/developers, and agency.gov/api should either be the direct url for the page or should redirect to the page.  

##Welcome
A brief welcome message can be used to provide context for the agency's mission and the role of developer outreach within it.  Your agency can set an appropriate and respectable standard by using this section to announce that the developer hub is the accumulation of the agency's current API offerings and that developers can return to find future APIs as they are posted there as well.  

##Catalog of APIs
The most important element of a developer hub is access to each of the APIs.  Usually, this takes the form of links along with a brief description.  Over time, it is preferable to standardize the individual API homepages into consistent developers subsections; however, many agencies begin by simply linking to the API homepages regardless of their location and styling within the agency's web presence.  Alternatively, several free and open source options exist that support a well-rounded catalog for the APIs.  

##Terms of Service
A terms of service (ToS) provides the legal framework by which the API provider conveys any rules or regulations that developers need to know.  Developers agree to the terms set out in the ToS by their use of the API itself and thus enable the API producer to regulate use of their API if necessary.  Common elements include but are not limited to attribution, modification, false representation, right to limit, right to terminate, and indemnification.  This is a particularly good area to review the Terms of Service of other government APIs and consider re-using their material instead of starting from scratch.

##Status Dashboard
As agency API efforts become more complex and developers grow more dependent on the services, the status of each service becomes increasingly important.  The goal of such a dashboard is to provide information on the current status of each API as well as planned future status changes (e.g., downtime during a system upgrade).  The dashboard can be manually maintained, with upcoming or current system updates written out.  A straightforward application can also be used to check the server response codes for each API on a regular basis (~every 5 minutes) and automatically change an API's status on the dashboard.  This has the benefit of ensuring quick updates for developers, whose applications may rely on this news.  Even with an automated dashboard, there is also a need for the API producer to provide human updates in the event of downtime in order to communicate with interested developers.  

##Apps Gallery
As agency and third-party developers consume the APIs in new projects, there is substantial value in highlighting the growing list of mobile and desktop applications that have been built on top of them.  Highlighting these products rewards adoption, promotes further creative work, and raises awareness about the returns on investment for the APIs.  This can often be done simply with links, descriptions, and screenshots.  

##Link to Open Source Projects
An agency's open source projects often relate to their API efforts and have similar potential customers.  Both SourceForge and GitHub offer [federal-friendly terms of service](http://www.howto.gov/web-content/resources/tools/terms-of-service-agreements/negotiated-terms-of-service-agreements), though GitHub has gained higher adoption due to its feature set, widespread popularity, and ease of use.  By offering more components of your agency's API packages as repositories online, you support faster developer adoption.


##Link to Agency Data Hub
An agency's static data is also of interest to developers both for direct use and also to inspire further ideas about what mashups are possible with the agency's APIs.  Including a link to the agency's public data catalog is a simple but important addition to the developer homepage.  

##Links to Other Relevant Sections
Each agency's web presence offers different material that may be of interest to potential developers, such as a Maps hub or Open Government page.  Including these links on the developer homepage provides grows the cross-ties between the teams behind each esections and helps site visitors to more readily understand the wider context of the agency's offerings and strategic direction.  

#Blog/Microblog
In order to deepen both interest and trust in your agency's API efforts, the developer outreach should include announcments and updates 



##Public Feedback Mechanism
Having a set of front-facing feedback mechanisms promotes an open and productive relationship between public developers and the agency.  When used to supplement other feedback mechanisms, this approach encourages greater public interest,
promotes a better agency response, and fosters ideation among the public.  Two important questions that warrant individual prompts include feedback on existing APIs and requests for new APIs.  This ensures that you have clear direction from those who use your APIs.  

Uservoice, Ideascale , and Dialogue App each offer [federal-friendly terms of service](http://www.howto.gov/web-content/resources/tools/terms-of-service-agreements/negotiated-terms-of-service-agreements) and provide robust ideation platforms for public feedback.  For a lighter weight implementation, you can use the similarly gov-friendly Disqus commenting platform to embed commenting functionality within a page that you host expressly for this purpose.  For an even simpler setup, you can author a series of 'open thread' blog posts that each encourage public feedback to a specific prompt and then link to those posts from the developer hub as a means of driving public feedback.
